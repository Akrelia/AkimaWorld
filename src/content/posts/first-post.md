# Why This Blog ?

A long time ago, I created a dev blog on my personal website because, well, that was the trend back then. But I didn’t have much to say, and I often forced myself to publish things that weren’t all that interesting.

That said, over the course of many exciting projects in previous months, I often caught myself thinking :

So, I finally decided to take the plunge and start a new fresh one !
But since there was no way I was going to spend time coding a custom site (my dev hours are already pretty packed), I built everything using [Astro](https://astro.build).

Here’s to writing as many interesting posts as possible !
